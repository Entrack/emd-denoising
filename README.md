## Abstract
This work is dedicated to the analysis of the paper "Detrending and denoising with empirical mode decompositions" by [Flandrin et al., 2004a]. The report compiles several relevant papers on the topic and presents a deconvoluted explanation of important aspects. The algorithm is tested against data of a variable fit, and the results show that it produces relatively good denoising/detrending even on non-standard data. The method for slight Hurst exponent estimation improvement is also proposed and tested yielding marginal gain in estimation quality.
